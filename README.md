#####Welcome to the future!

Anaglyphic is a small javascript/jquery library and chrome extension for turning a website into a 3d anaglyph (think red/blue glasses) based on the DOM of that website.

To use, clone the repo and load it into chrome as an unpacked extension. 
You can do that by pointing google chrome at `chrome://extensions`. Turn developer mode on, then click on load unpacked extension. Select the anaglyphic folder and you're good to go! Click the 3d glasses next to your address bar on any page and see what it looks like in 3d.
